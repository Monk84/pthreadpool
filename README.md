# pthreadpool
Dummy threadpool implementation based on pthread lib

TODO:
- basic version - create/init, config, cleanup/destroy, push_task, get_task, some thoughts about queue (easiest - use linux list)
- think about shared openssl dynamic library, MAYBE ossl_threads or how to call them O_o
- maybe some ideas from fbjkjv
- Makefile
